This project built a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. We implemented two approaches: memory-based collaborative filtering (k-NN) and model-based matrix factorization (SVD). The k-NN method identified similar users by calculating cosine similarity between their rating patterns, then recommended movies those users liked. The SVD approach decomposed the user-item rating matrix into latent factors representing hidden preferences (e.g., genre affinity).

The system achieved a competitive RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of ~0.9, indicating accurate rating predictions. We also used the Surprise library to streamline SVD implementation and evaluate performance via cross-validation.

Recommendation systems power personalized experiences on platforms like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon. Key challenges include cold-start problems (new users/items) and scalability, which we addressed through hybrid techniques (combining collaborative + content-based filtering). The project demonstrated how linear algebra and ML can drive business value by increasing user engagement. Built in Google Colab, it provided a scalable foundation for real-world recommender systems.
